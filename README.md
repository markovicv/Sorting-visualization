# Sorting Visualizator

### Project overview:
Projects shows a visualization of common sorting algorithms which are used in computer science. It allows you to pause,resume and start a certain algorithm, 
change the color of the visualization, increase or decrase the speed of sorting and choose which type of visualization you want.

### Technology and implementation:
- Observer pattern
- Multithreading
- Swing (GUI)

Currently only two algorithms are implemented (quic ksort and bubble sort)
